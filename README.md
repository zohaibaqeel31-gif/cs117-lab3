Assembly Reflections
Q1. What did you notice about registers and instruction?
Ans. Registers are limited and must be managed carefully, each instruction is very low-level.
Q2. How is coding in python is different from Assemblty?
Ans. Coding in Assembly in harder, longer, and less readable compared to Python. Assembly is low level language while python is high level language.
Python Reflection
Q1. Why Python is easy to use?
Ans. Python is a high level language and it resemble more commonly to english which is easily understood by everyone thus python is easy to understand.
Q2. Which feature of python help abstraction?
Ans. The Loops feature of python was the most abstraction because by using different types of loop we can do many work repeadly and with ease.
Comparison Table

1. Feature: Variable Storage

Assembly Example: Register (EAX)

Python Example: x = 5

Notes: In Assembly, variables are stored in CPU registers; in Python, variables are stored in memory automatically.



2. Feature: Printing Output

Assembly Example: INT 21h

Python Example: print()

Notes: In Assembly, printing requires interrupt services (low-level); in Python, printing is a built-in function and much simpler.



3. Feature: Arithmetic

Assembly Example: ADD AX, BX

Python Example: x + y

Notes: Assembly uses explicit instructions for operations; Python uses operators directly.
